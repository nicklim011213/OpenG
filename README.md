# OpenG
 
This project uses OpenGL to create a graphics engine and then save and load the scene  
and custom data structures to hold the items in the scene. This project is still very much  
It is a work in progress but when it is completed it should be able to save and load a JSON file  
that will define where and what is placed in the scene. Edits to the JSON file should
reflect on the scene.
